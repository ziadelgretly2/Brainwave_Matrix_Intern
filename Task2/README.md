ðŸ’¡ Project Idea:
I wanted to analyze user sentiment about iPhone 15 and Samsung S24 Ultra using real data from Reddit.

ðŸ›  Steps I followed:
Collected data using the Reddit API (PRAW), pulling 500 posts.
Used Python with TextBlob to classify each post as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
Exported the data into a CSV file.
Visualized the results using Power BI.

ðŸ“Š The dashboard shows:
Review counts for each device.
Sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
A direct comparison between the two devices based on sentiment.

ðŸ“Œ Insights:
61% of Samsung S24 Ultra reviews were positive.
iPhone 15 had 47% positive reviews, with a higher percentage of neutral sentiment.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used: Python (PRAW, TextBlob) | Reddit API | Power BI
