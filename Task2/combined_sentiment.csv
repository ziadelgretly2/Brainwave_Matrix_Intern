1721245376,My iPhone 15 review,"**Introduction:**

Hello, my name is Elie, and I have had an iPhone 15 for about a week now. This is my experience and here is my review. Over the past week, I have seen posts asking about what phone one should get, as they need an upgrade. I also know that for most people (as well as the mods) on the subreddit, it must get annoying to hear that same question over and over. I also understand that other reviews, albeit on YouTube, TikTok, blogs, and Reddit, may not give you the answers you are seeking, and only pointing out the little differences, catering to an audience that may upgrade from a 13 or a 14. **If you have an iPhone 12 or older, this is the review for you.** Having upgraded from an iPhone Xr, I want to highlight the noticeable improvements that have made my life tangibly easier.

**Part 1: My reason for upgrading**

My iPhone Xr was a good phone. It was good enough for college (in Quebec, we have 2 years of college in between university (3 years) and high school (grades 7-11)), as I was able to check my schedule, message teachers, and other academic stuff. However there were some issues: it was chronically laggy, basic multitasking was a struggle, apps crashed, load times were abysmal, the battery was significantly degraded, and storage was full, and most of it was iOS, documents for school, and apps that I use for school. So, with this in mind, I decided to buy a new phone. 

**Part 2: iPhone 15, and my first impressions**

I was able to get a “preloved” iPhone 15 (black) from my carrier at a good price. It turns out that this phone is only 3 months old, and was used for a day (2 charging cycles when I first checked) before being returned by the previous owner. It had a tiny scratch that is barely noticeable on the frame, which is easily covered by my case. Holding the phone, it feels like a premium product. I can really see, and appreciate, the 17 years of history, and innovation behind the device. 

**Part 3: the changes, and improvements, on the iPhone 15**

This part will have sub-parts touching on each noticeable change that I have experienced, and how it has improved my life.

*Part 3.1: Dynamic Island*

What the iPhone Xr, and iPhone X by extension, started, feels almost perfected on this phone. There’s a saying that is usually said sarcastically that goes “it’s not a flaw, it’s a feature”. While the notch does get in the way of your screen, it is also definitively Apple’s design. Whenever you see a phone with a notch, most people assume it’s an iPhone. For me, the Dynamic Island is incredibly useful evolution of the notch. Whenever I’m listening to music, I can change songs, pause, play, replay, rewind, etc, while I am scrolling through instagram, or trying to navigate on google maps or transit. When I’m calling my pharmacy, I can turn on speaker/mute while I’m looking for my prescription information, or add an appointment to my calendar while I’m on the phone with my doctor. When I’m navigating, I can see the route and ETA on the island while I’m letting my friends know when I will arrive to see them. Being in Quebec, Canada, whenever I’m asking for directions, but it’s difficult to understand, we can talk to the translate app on Dynamic Island, while I’m looking up the information the person is giving me. These little things have made my life tangibly easier. Sure, the Face ID may be distracting while watching content, and it does take up a lot of real estate on my screen, yet without sacrificing the seamless faceID unlock system, or camera quality, it uses that space effectively.

*Part 3.2: MagSafe*

MagSafe is to the iPhone as the picatinny rail is to modern firearms. Just like gun attachments, you can find many accessories that fits your phone. You can wirelessly charge, use portable batteries, wallets, phone stands, and mounts to the back of your phone, and use what you need. For me, I use MagSafe on phone mounts for photoshoots, as well as in my car for navigation and entertainment. Since my car is from 2004, it cannot use Apple carplay. The mount I had before was absolute shit. It would pinch my fingers, my phone would fall off whenever I went over uneven/unpaved roads, I would have to plug my phone in to charge, and I have to place it on a certain spot so it doesn’t press any buttons. The way I had to mount it wasn’t secure, and I would either have to block an AC vent or risk my phone moving one of my mirrors by pressing the buttons. However, with MagSafe, I can simply place my phone on the mount, fasten my seatbelt, start the car, and go. I don’t have to worry about it dying, falling off, hindering any functionality of the vents or mirrors. I once even drove over a speed bump at-speed accidentally, and the phone stayed on. Whenever I need to take photos, I can mount my phone on my ring light, and it’s ready. These are just 2 uses I have for MagSafe. The modularity of this system is excellent, and you can find an attachment that fits your needs and lifestyle.

*Part 3.3: stereo speakers and the display*

I’m putting these two together since most people use them together. I’ll start with the sound, and end with the screen. When I first played music outloud to test the Dynamic Island, I immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality. So basically, rather than just having speakers on the bottom of the phone, there are also speakers on the top of the phone, where you would put your ear when you make a phone call. By doing this, the quality of music improves, as there is more depth, and you can play music at a reasonable volume since the sound waves are travelling in more directions, making it more acoustically flexible (if that is the right term). You can hear a wide range of sounds, tones, notes, etc, making that shitty TikTok you’re showing your friend a tiny bit more funny. That TikTok is then complemented with the OLED display. Looking at it, the screen feels like the warm, cozy feeling of a bedside lamp or fairy lights in someone’s bedroom. The screen feels like it has room to show you what you want to see, the way you want to see it. Colours feel more colourful, videos and photos feel more immersive, darks are darker, and the quality is better than my own eyesight (albeit, I do wear glasses). The phone is as bright as you need it to be, when you need it to be. Whenever I’m driving, and the sun is bright, I can still see the GPS on screen, and I know where to go. Whenever I am backstage at a show during a play (I’m a theatre major, specializing in script writing, directing, and producing plays and other live entertainment) as an assistant stage manager, I am able to put my phone in its theatre/show focus mode. This puts the phone on its lowest brightness, changes the background to black, and the clock is a dark blue (we use blue light backstage so it is less visible), in order to not have unnecessary light that distracts the audience. With iOS 18, I can make all of the apps blue as well. With the LCD display, the pixels are backlit by a white light, so there is still some light. With an OLED display, when the screen is black, the pixels are turned off. This means that the information I need on my phone is the only visible light coming from my phone. 

*Part 3.4: Bluetooth and connectivity*

Again, I’m putting these two together since they go hand in hand, especially because I charge my Sony Bluetooth headphones with a USB-C charger. If I’m listening to music while writing, and I need to take the trash out, I can leave my phone in my room, go from the 3rd floor of my house, to the driveway, and drag my garbage can to the corner of my driveway, without losing connection to my phone. When I come back, and my headphones are low on battery, I can take the charger from my phone, and use it to charge my headphones, while I go off and run some errands. The fact that my phone uses USB-C while being an iPhone (let’s be honest, most people buy iPhones because they’re iPhones, no matter the spreadsheet facts) is a huge deal for me. If I’m on the bus or at school, and my phone is low on battery, I don’t have to go around looking like an idiot while asking “does anyone have an iPhone charger?”. Instead, I can ask for a charger, I can borrow almost any charger, whether it’s for headphones, a laptop, vape, Nintendo switch, game controller, cameras, or speakers, because it is USB-C. That level of convenience is what I miss about my old Samsung, and I’m happy that I have it back.

*Part 3.5: the other stuff that most reviewers talk about (battery, storage, processing speed, and cameras)*

Most reviews focus on these, so I’ll simply touch the surface on these battery, the storage, the processor, and the cameras. The battery lasts all day, and the charger the phone came does its job well. When I started writing this about an hour ago, my phone was at 13%, now it’s 80%. I got to 13% between yesterday afternoon and this morning, even though I was doing a photography session for a personal project. Speaking of photography, the cameras are more than sufficient for everyday use. The quality is phenomenal, each lens can capture those special moments, or that one stupidly angled picture you spam to your friends. The processor and storage is good for my needs, and I’m in fine arts. If you’re an everyday user, it will work for your everyday tasks, and even some demanding challenges. I was able to take in-depth, and complicated pictures for my project, and my phone was able to store it, and I can upload it to my hardrive (albeit, it’s slow, so I mostly use iCloud and OneDrive). 

**Conclusion**

My iPhone 15 is a significant improvement over my iPhone Xr, and I am very happy with the upgrade. The 5 years of change is indescribable, since you need to live it to experience it. I use my phone like a Swiss Army knife. The quality of the Swiss Army knife is excellent, and if you have a problem, it probably has a solution. Do you need to sharpen a stick to roast marshmallows over the fireplace? The knife will make short work and get straight to the point. However, if a bear attacks you by the campfire, the knife will probably not help you. Just like a Swiss Army knife, the iPhone 15 will meet most of your needs, yet it has its limits. But if you need specific tools for specific tasks, there is a huge market of tools, software, and accessories that will work seamlessly with the iPhone 15 thanks to USB-C and MagSafe. The phone itself is excellent, from performance and cameras to storage and battery. The experience of using it is phenomenal, thanks to Dynamic Island, the screen, processor, Bluetooth, and speakers. As for flaws, I haven’t experienced much that I couldn’t handle. 

I hope that this review helps you make an informed decision. If you want my, or someone else’s advice, feel free to comment, and most people here will probably have an answer. Good luck in your search! ","My iPhone 15 review **Introduction:**

1723447414,iPhone 15 Review: Upgraded from iPhone XR,"I upgraded from an Phone XR to the base iPhone 15 in blue with 256 GB storage in Jan, and after several months of use, 
here’s my detailed review.

Upgrades Compared to the iPhone XR

1.	Display: 
The iPhone 15’s display is a massive upgrade. The high-resolution OLED screen is super bright, reaching up to 2000 nits outdoors, which is a huge leap from the XR.

2.	Cameras: 
The camera system is significantly better, offering four times the resolution and adding an ultra-wide lens, which the XR lacked. The 2x zoom without losing quality is impressive, and I can now take portraits of objects—something I couldn’t do with the XR. The default 24 MP mode delivers excellent quality, with colors and HDR that are leagues ahead of what the XR offered. Plus, features like Cinematic Mode, Action Mode, Night Time Video, and a much-improved selfie camera with autofocus make this a solid upgrade.

3.	Speakers: 
The speakers are louder and deliver more bass, which enhances the overall media experience.

4.	USB-C:
 The shift to USB-C is a game-changer in terms of convenience and versatility. I can now access my external SSD directly from my phone and connect to a TV in high resolution.

5.	Battery Life: 
The battery life has seen a noticeable improvement. It easily lasts a full day of heavy use, which is more than sufficient for me.

6.	MagSafe: MagSafe has completely changed how I charge my phone. I’ve stopped using wired charging altogether and invested in a few MagSafe accessories like a battery pack and a wallet, which are genuinely useful.

7.	Design: The frosted back and slightly curved edges feel great in hand, giving the phone a premium look and feel. I also appreciate the muted color options this year.

Pros & Cons

Pros:

	1.	Great cameras
	2.	Decent battery life
	3.	Excellent display
	4.	Amazing performance
	5.	USB-C

Cons:

1. The speakers tend to rattle at volumes above 80%, a common issue across all iPhone 15 models that Apple hasn’t addressed yet.
2. Slightly overpriced, especially considering it’s essentially last year’s Pro model with fewer premium features.
3. The USB-C port only supports USB 2 data transfer speeds, which is no faster than the old Lightning port.
4. It doesn’t include Apple’s AI-driven features, which is a significant omission for a phone sold as a flagship.
5. Lacks support for console-quality games, unlike the Pro models.
6. Missing some advanced camera features like better zoom, macro mode, and a superior ultra-wide camera.
7. You don’t get a charger & earphones in the box which absolutely sucks.

Should You Still Consider Buying It?

If you’re thinking about buying the iPhone 15, I’d suggest waiting for the iPhone 16, which is only a month away. If the iPhone 16 doesn’t bring major upgrades, you could still get the iPhone 15 at a reduced price. However, if you’re used to a 120Hz display, the iPhone 15 might not feel as smooth. But if you’re someone who doesn’t notice the difference, it’s an excellent phone for most people.

What Could Have Made It Better?

	1.	Apple intelligence support
	2.	USB 3.0 data transfer speeds
	3.	At least a 90Hz display
	4.	Speakers that don’t rattle

Conclusion:

Overall, the iPhone 15 is a solid phone for 90% of users and a significant upgrade over the iPhone 14, which was a lackluster release. It’s definitely a great upgrade from the XR and I don’t regret buying it.","iPhone 15 Review: Upgraded from iPhone XR I upgraded from an Phone XR to the base iPhone 15 in blue with 256 GB storage in Jan, and after several months of use,

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.","Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.

1733910967,Just got my iphone 15 after 15 years of android,"I will make it simple and quick pros+cons and price was 2nd hand battery 94% for 550usd

Pros:
1-I love the design as android phones became looking cheap and ugly.
2-since I live in Egypt and due to inflation so it holds its price on resale.
3-ios has changed a lot as it looks now more like a polished version of android.
4-it feels like apps were developed originally for IOS and Android is 2nd priority.
5-cameras are easy simple and always deliver I love the consistency.

Cons:
1-battery is not impressive as expected to get from 2023 model but it's solid still.
2-lowest brightness is not good enouph for bed time still too bright sadly..
3-slow charging speeds
4-night mode is not that good compared to pros models on older phones

1740660494,4 months with my iPhone 15 Pro ( A review from a lifelong android user ),"I got my iPhone 15 Pro Black Titanium 256GB (brand new) for $850 around 4 months ago. And I'm not gonna lie, I love it. I didn’t get the iPhone 16 Pro because I just didn’t find the camera button very appealing. It was very less of an upgrade. Previously I was using a budget android. From that to this flagship was a huge upgrade indeed. Though there are many things that I like and dislike about this phone.

I already had a MacBook M3 Pro when I bought this phone. I also bought AirPods Pro 2 with it. I can tell the ecosystem of Apple devices is really seamless. The photo and video quality on this phone is really great, just like almost every other flagship of course. But one thing I really like is its RAW formats. The ProRAW photos and ProRes Apple Log are just insanely good. I don't think any other smartphone in the market can produce raw videos like ProRes Apple Log of an iPhone. Just love it. Another thing I love about iPhone is the apps. For some reason, apps on iPhone are just more polished and smooth compared to Android. I don't know if it's just me or if it's really the case. And many more devs and companies are prioritizing Apple devices over Android, which is why many great apps are only available on iPhones. Regardless, I really love some of its apps.

One thing I really dislike about this phone is its battery life. Battery life is really bad compared to Androids of this budget range. I get max 5-6hr screen-on time as I am a heavy user. Sometimes I get only 4 hours. I am needing to use a power bank if I plan on staying out the whole dat. And there are some more things that are missing on iPhone like clipboard and universal back gesture. iPhones sometimes feel like they prioritize form over function. And as much as I love the smooth animations, sometimes it's just irritating. Some animations are just too slow, e.g., the locking animation. It takes like half a second to lock the screen. And I wish the camera had Pro Mode.

Anyways. It’s a great phone regardless.","4 months with my iPhone 15 Pro ( A review from a lifelong android user ) I got my iPhone 15 Pro Black Titanium 256GB (brand new) for $850 around 4 months ago.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…”

I called our internet company because I knew we were at a lowered rated and was hoping to keep it. The normal rate is $75 a month, we were paying $30 but it was set to expire that month. When we called we said we were thinking of moving to a different company and wanted to know if they could match or give us a lower rate. They agreed to keep our discount for another 12 months. That was last year and since my husband is still in school, we really were hoping to keep it. We made the call again and they agreed to keep it at $30 a month for another 12 months. 


Bills like this are ""negotiable."" Call and find out what they can do for you!

When we called we said we were thinking of moving to a different company and wanted to know if they could match or give us a lower rate. They agreed to keep our discount for another 12 months. That was last year and since my husband is still in school, we really were hoping to keep it. We made the call again and they agreed to keep it at $30 a month for another 12 months. 


Bills like this are ""negotiable."" Call and find out what they can do for you!


edit: yep, math was way off. actually saved around $540. Also, I know the post title sounds like Geico commercial.  ",Positive,iPhone 15,12/29/2016

I did the same thing. Went from a 15 pro to a pixel 9 pro xl. After reading that thread I was a little worried about making the transition. Rest assured -- ZERO issues. The phone is silky smooth and runs instagram great. I don't use that chinese propaganda app tik tok so who knows about that but instagram is awesome and overall the phone performs great. 

Pros: 

* excellent performance overall, I don't game so I could care less about that
* pictures are awesome and photo editing tools are great
* screen is gorgeous
* AI is very nice so far 
* keyboard is much better than iphone

Cons:

* RCS isn't enabled on iphones yet so that's the biggest handicap right now with my friends who use imessage but next month that will change.

To be honest, I'm shocked how piss poor the video quality is when uploaded from the Pixel. I did a side by side comparison on Tik Tok with the exact same settings. The colors are much better on the iPhone, much smoother, way less noise and the STABILIZATION...? It looks like my Pixel is attached to a spacecraft when I do recordings where I move a bit.

Also, just in the preview with 50 MP the screen lags all the time. The pictures looks way worse before I shoot em, and good after when I check in my photo folder. Why is it like that?

Just scrolling on these apps is way slower and way less smooth on the Pixel. From time to time the videos on TT even just stops randomly.

Will this ever be fixed?

1730345775,iPhone 15 Pro survived being under 12 feet of water for 30 hours.,So when I was on a dock I was bumped resulting in my phone falling into a lake. I luckily was able to get someone to dive and recover it but they weren’t able to until the next evening. When they found it to my surprise it was still on. I immediately turned it off and wiped it down. I came with a big Ziplock bag with the little gel packets for moisture and put my phone in there for an entire day. The next day I downloaded an app which acts essentially like the Apple Watch water ejection feature by playing a certain frequency with the speakers and a few more drops of water came out. I turned it back off and left it in the bag for another 24 hours. It has been about two weeks and the phone has been working perfectly. I’m pretty impressed that somehow it managed to survive and couldn’t be happier that I didn’t have to go through the trouble of getting a new one.,iPhone 15 Pro survived being under 12 feet of water for 30 hours.

Edit: Employees in the service center in Lebanon were so nice and kind, they also resealed my phone after drying it completely. However I'm still not confident to get my IP68 rated device near water. And what did I do to carry a reparid device for this price?",Negative,Samsung S24 Ultra,9/11/2024

But Samsung seems to be playing the ugly game with S25. It's not about waiting for a month or two for the updates (I am on one ui 7 beta) or whether Now Brief is a useful feature or not. It appears like a shift in company's principle and as a consumer I wouldn't be any different from Apple fan boys if I act like it's normal.

1718102387,I regret buying the Galaxy S24 Ultra.,"Because I should've bought the Plus instead.  I came from the S20+ and before that, I had a S9+, S6, S4 and S3. The problem isn't the size but the squared corners and the cases. The S24+ and the Ultra are as good as the same in size but the rounded corners of the Plus make a huge difference as to how it feels in the hand and how you use the device.

If there was a chance to return it, I would've, but I can't and neither can I get the S24+ for cheaper than I got the Ultra for since I used many discounts, pre-ordered and all that. The main selling point for me and the reason I got the Ultra is because I live in the Netherlands and it was the only phone with Snapdragon. Additionally, I wanted to try something new and I had tested the phone out for hours at the Samsung store, but the phones had big metal devices attached to it (to prevent theft) so it didn't really allow me to get a good feel for the phone.

When I actually got the phone, it felt too big and I was thinking of returning it, but everyone had told me that I just need to get used to the feeling. I'm used to it now for sure, but it's just unpleasant.

If the S25+ drops, I'll try and see if I can trade my S24 Ultra in for one and get a huge discount, otherwise I'll just sell this phone and use the money for the S25+. It's a long way from now but it's the only solution.","I regret buying the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Because I should've bought the Plus instead.

1727393915,My 6 day adventure with the samsung s24 ultra and why i'm back to my iPhone,"This post is really a short review of my week long experience with the Samsung S24 Ultra and why i went back to Apple. I'm just trying to provide my experience for users who think about switching and what i liked and disliked about Samsung and Android in general.

So, I've been an average iPhone user for the past decade, in which i got 8 of the 10 past iPhones. After watching the 16 Presentation two weeks ago, I was quite disappointed by the progress of Apple and thought about switching to Android. I've researched devices that would work for my needs and wants. After reading a bunch of reviews and watching a boatload of Youtube vids (Quite the mistake, thb.), i narrowed it down to the following four Smartphones:

1. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
2. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL
3. OnePlus 12
4. Sony Xperia 1 VI

I chose the S24 Ultra since it had an amazing promo with a heavily discounted prize (CHF 1'099 for the 512 GB) and a free A9+ Tab or Buds 2 (I think). I didn't go for the Pixel because of the prize, the OnePlus 12 and Sony Xperia 1 VI, because they didn't have an official store in Switzerland, and I didn't want to wait for weeks if something's wrong with my phone since i really appreciated Apple's fast response, especially with apple care. 

I honestly don't care for camera functions. I rarely take pictures with the main camera. Although, I always got the pro max models, because of the better camera. I'm easily influenced by advertisement, i guess. In a new phone, I look mainly for smooth scrolling, good memory, a functional OS and optimized apps. The rest is a nice bonus. For storage, the 128 GB is more than enough for me.

Anyway, I got the S24 Ultra and was acting like a small child on Christmas eve and spent the weekend transferring my data, installing new apps, and generally customizing the phone like I wanted to. Here's a short pro/contra on my experience with the S24 Ultra.

**pro:**  
-Impressive display, like day and night, especially in bright environments.  
-Love the fingerprint sensor. I always thought FaceID was more comfortable, but I really prefer the fingerprint scan now. Really a bummer that Apple doesn't provide one. Maybe it'll be a brand new, innovative feature in a couple of years :P  
-Insane customization options. From screens to how apps look to general coloring of the notification bar... it's awesome.  
-Great camera, much better than my 14 pro max. I took some pictures and was amazed, but as mentioned, not a selling point for me.  
-Able to take notes with the pen, which made me feel more creative, even though I was just noting down words and numbers. Still, a nice toy to improve my writing.   
-Customization of the lock and home screen will get a special shout out. Especially after finding out that you can choose multiple pictures for the lock screen, and that they rotate every time you close the phone. The iPhone can do this, as well. Just found out after i switched back and wanted to keep my changing background.

**cons:**  
-The screen wasn't as reactive as my iPhone 14 Pro Max. There have been some posts on reddit mentioning the same thing, speculating that the new anti-reflective screen lost some responsiveness in comparison even to previous Ultras. This made switching between apps or going back to the home screen a nightmare with a case on. It helped when I went back to the old navigation system and did some tweaking in the dev settings, but still not the same as on my iPhone.  
-Notification settings. I hated it. I got vibrations and sounds that i got a new notification. But no pop-up for some apps I used for work, and needed to know quickly if it's important or not. Just vibration and sound. If I wanted to look up what happened, I had to pull down the notification bar and look at the new notification. Same on the always on screen. I really disliked the way notifications were posted. Nothing like I was used to in my old iPhone. After playing around with the settings for some hours and looking up posts, I found out it's a long known Samsung problem. Other Android brands don't seem to suffer from this.  
-Brave browser on Android. I used it on iOS and loved it. No ads, no tracking, no cookie consent form, and therefore downloaded it from the Play store. I was astonished at how many functions were missing from the Android version, even though it was supposed to be the freedom and individualization OS. Got another browser, though, so not a deal breaker, but was quite disappointed.  
-I didn't like Samsung's phone app. Especially the Dial. It looked too pressed together. Didn't care for Google's either.   
-Same with the keyboard. I didn't like the stock Samsung keyboard, but after a long time of customization, it was quite okay. Really hated Google and Microsofts', as well.   
-App optimization. It somehow wasn't as good as on iOS. Maybe because every company has its own devices and you have to optimize for thousands and thousands of phones. idk. I got this especially from webnovel. Hated scrolling there, since there was always a long blank space at the end of every chapter. Plus, the scrolling didn't feel as fluid, even though the 120 hz refresh was on. Quite weird.  
-Didn't like how the phone felt in my hands. Much more comfortable with the iPhone. Guess the form factor wasn't for me.   
-Samsungs bloatware. It was quite annoying. Especially since Samsung has its own cloud and app store installed and i just ended up having two of them (Google and Samsung). Like, what's the point?  
-No Samsung Care in Switzerland, which made me buy a case. I didn't like that. 

Honestly, coming from an iPhone, the customization possibility is great but after a while, overwhelming.  
  
Things just worked on the iPhone. True, I was more constrained regarding customization but Apple's original apps all worked great, the apps from the app store were beautifully optimized and everything was just simple and easy. As mentioned, I'm not a heavy duty user, don't care about the camera and just want a simple and working phone. All these advertised freedoms on Android were honestly wasted on someone like me. 

I know i could install apps even outside the official app store, but that just made it even more confusing and in my opinion, unnecessary. I know that competition is good for the customer but i got the same feeling from all these app stores as today's streaming market, where i need an Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Paramount+,  Sky and Apple TV just to have all the shows available. After a while, it's just overwhelming and i get the urge to cancel everything and go back to good ol' pirating (little rant on the side, but i really hate that i need all these streaming providers).

Anyway, I returned the S24 and lo and behold; I had to pay a 20% fine for unboxing. Quite the low blow. After paying CHF 220.- for using a phone for a week, I'm in no mood to experiment again with Android.

1744810498,I just realized all my passwords were saved in the clipboard history of my Galaxy S24 Ultra,"So these last few days I've been thinking of ways to improve the security on my phone in case it ever gets stolen. I use a lot of apps where I have money stored or linked credit cards (my bank app, streaming services, Google Play Store, exchanges, etc.), so I’ve been messing around with different features. Like, “ok, I want to put a password on some apps” → Secure Folder. “What if I lose my phone?” → ok, there’s this: https://smartthingsfind.samsung.com/login, and so on.

","I just realized all my passwords were saved in the clipboard history of my Galaxy S24 Ultra So these last few days I've been thinking of ways to improve the security on my phone in case it ever gets stolen. I use a lot of apps where I have money stored or linked credit cards (my bank app, streaming services, Google Play Store, exchanges, etc.), so I’ve been messing around with different features. Like, “ok, I want to put a password on some apps” → Secure Folder. “What if I lose my phone?” → ok, there’s this: https://smartthingsfind.samsung.com/login, and so on.

You guys have *no idea* how big a deal this is. This antireflective display is just crazy good, and insanely more usable in daylight as well as in a normal room lit from above, especially in dark mode. Yet Samsung just like glossed over this on their presentation the other day.

I bet you Apple would've spent like 15 minutes hammering this feature into your head like they did with that stupid dynamic island (which I fell for). Samsung really need to market this display and its antireflective coating as one of their man features, and not just gloss over it like that.

I've got a lot to say about the iPhone and specifically iOS, which I will do in a more detailed post later on (short version, Android is freedom), but this is definitely the first thing you will notice straightaway.

EDIT: To everyone asking me what happens when you put a screen protector on it: I don't know. Haven't used a screen protector since forever, and won't use it on this phone either.

1706797194,Why I'm back to Pixel 8 Pro after trying S24 Ultra for a week,"Hi Guys,

I've decided to try out the new Samsung S24 Ultra and probably stay with it for a while or at least until Pixel 9 come out but I just swapped my sim card back in the Pixel 8 Pro and I couldn't be happier.

Why I switched back:

1. Software - I can't stand the whole incostistency. Honestly they need to stick to one unified UI for interface and core applications. Samsung is a mess with two different design languages for core functions. Even in settings you can find traces from both worlds. Call me a nerd but I can't stand this inconsitency it looks and feels awful.
2. Software again - why the hell you need to have two applications for each core function. This again is just a total mess. If you decide to use Samsungs's you end up with phone only applications. If you decide to use google, why the hell you need Samsung AI. It doesn't work with Google applications.
3. Camera - I'm sorry Samsung but the camera is not onpaar with Pixel 8 Pro. I couldn't find even one situation where Samsung makes better photos. Pixel color science and computational photography are unmatched. (I know it is subjective nevertheless)
4. Price - what a hefty price tag. I can buy Pixel 8 Pro almost half the price of S24 Ultra. I'm sorry it is just too much for a phone...for any phone.

May be also some other small things but overall the lack of consistency is making me crazy. As well as the crappy camera especially trying to take a photo of two toddler twins constantly running and jumping around.

If some of you are considering the switch think very carefully before pulling the trigger.","Why I'm back to Pixel 8 Pro after trying S24 Ultra for a week Hi Guys,

Open Instagram and slide down the notifications area and you'll get the colours and bright whites you're used to.

It's like apps can turn HDR on but the ui doesn't use it. If you do the Instagram notification thing and see it's bright. Then close Instagram and as fast as possible pull down the notification area. You'll see that it fades back to looking dull over about a second. It was my boss that pointed this out and I was easily able to replicate it.

Telling us that the display is tuned differently ignores that natural vs vivid yields zero difference. But they make it seem like it's a user choice thing that they weren't expecting.

Hi All,

I wanted to try to get together an aggregate post to bring the state of the display to their attention.

On the homescreen or app drawer the colours are awful. But put content on and it's great.

I did a side by side with my S22 Ultra and when playing videos or in apps the S24 is brilliant but on the homescreen it's hot garbage.

It appears to be software not hardware which you can see by...

Pull down the notification area and you'll see it's all dull.
Open Instagram and a comments section.
Then pull down the notification area and you'll see that the area looks as you'd expect.

I don't think it's anything to do with the glass or the screen as some assert. I think it's a stupid software glitch.

Also Samsung for the love of all that is holy, give us some real options to adjust the display. 2 modes that are hardly any different is not enough. We need to be able to adjust brightness contrast saturation etc.

EDIT...

I think the issue is there's ZERO difference when you switch between vivid and natural.

It's like it's stuck on natural.

Changing wallpaper does nothing.
Turning off or on the adaptive stuff does nothing.
If you try to adjust colour temp or the individual colour sliders.. it does nothing.

I've asked 2 colleagues about their experiences and theirs are identical.

Edit 2...

WHEN YOU WATCH CONTENT THE BLACKS ARE INKY THE COLOURS ARE VIBRANT. THIS IS IN THE UI. IT CANNOT BE HARDWARE. IT CANNOT BE THE GLASS. IT CANNOT BE THE COATING. IF IT WERE ANYTHING BUT SOFTWARE IT WOULDN'T LOOK AWESOME IN SOME CASES AND BAD IN OTHERS.

Capitalised because I am sick of people saying what about the blacks or it must be the screen. It is software. Fullstop. 

It is also NOT BRIGHTNESS. It is DULL COLOURS.

1706440433,S24 Ultra - why does the camera force post processing on my photos?,"Hi all!

Just recently I've got the S24 Ultra coming from a Pixel 6 Pro, and the phone has been really good piece of kit.

The one thing I can't get over though, is there a way to stop Samsung from post processing every photo we take?

Here's couple examples:

[Here's how the photo looks like before I press capture on the camera](https://i.imgur.com/aiPzrKQ.jpg)


[Here's how it looks like in my gallery for a second before it gets auto-processed by Samsung](https://i.imgur.com/lGFo8hj.jpg)

[And after a second, my photo disappears, gets post-processed in the gallery and here's the end result](https://i.imgur.com/lMaCn3N.jpg)


Here's two of them next to each other so you can compare on mobile:
[Link](https://www.imgur.com/a/7bp71Er)

Now personally, I don't mind a bit of processing to lift clarity, but the whole thing just feels outlandish. Living in Cymru/Wales with it always being cloudy, sometimes things are a bit darker and a mix of gray, and I love it that way.

I don't want my photos to try and be something they're not. Not everything needs the contrast lifted by +100 and EV+2. To make it worse, if I want the original look back, **I then have to put work to remove the processing that Samsung has done**, having to try and post-process the photo in the camera edit just to get back to the original result, feels a bit daft!

So,

Has anyone figured out a way to either stop that, or is there a mode that you can disable, different camera app, any ideas?","S24 Ultra - why does the camera force post processing on my photos? Hi all!

1719907140,Regretting purchasing the Galaxy S24 Ultra,"I won't be surprised if this post gets down voted, but hear me out.

I went from an iPhone 13 Pro Max to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. At first, the phone felt like a breath of fresh air. It felt like freedom in my hands.

3 months later, and issues started occurring. Most notably, the battery drains really fast, even though I don't have anything crazy on the phone. The notifications is what killed my experience mostly.

An emergency happened and I was about 30 minutes away from home. My parents got locked out of the apartment while the weather was a scorching 35°C (95**°**F) and a neighbor tried to call me and message me, to which I didn't receive a thing.

I got to a store, and when I unlocked my phone, all the missing calls and messages came in bulk. The worse part? The missing calls and messages were 15 minutes earlier when I checked...

I called the neighbor, fortunately they got them inside the apartment building, but I had to rush back home to open the apartment door for them.

My parents are both disabled, so having them waiting in the heat was not a fun experience.

It's safe to say that after this experience, while I cannot return the phone, I'm selling it and going back to an iPhone. In terms of reliability, Samsung loses this one.

EDIT: Also forgot to add that this morning, my girlfriend had to wake me up. Alarm didn't ring even though the volume was almost full, and it was set to 6:45AM. I woke up at 7:30. This happened before as well, and I am not a heavy sleeper.

If it was user error, I wouldn't have posted this, and I would certainly get it fixed.

Now in come the down votes!

Update: Welp... after owning an iPhone 15 Pro for about 7 months, I am a money-spender and went back to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. This time, I kept everything default, and it's working as expected. So any issues that I had with the prior phone...

**It was user error.**

Yes, I'm admitting that I am the idiot who didn't decide to try fixing the problem instead of trading to an iPhone.

I am now a happy owner of a Samsung, and it's staying that way.","Regretting purchasing the Galaxy S24 Ultra I won't be surprised if this post gets down voted, but hear me out.

At 226 grams it's lighter than the S24 ultra, 232 grams. 
Z fold6 239 grams. 

Now with IPX8 Rating (Samsung wins here, but it's an upgrade from previous model)

Magic V3  has flexible triple rear camera system, consisting of a 50MP main camera (f/1.6), a 40MP ultrawide camera (f/2.2, autofocus, 112-degree field-of-view), and a 50MP 3.5x periscope lens (f/3.0). A 20MP camera on each screen handles selfies and video calls.

1719359302,The S24 Ultra camera is terrible. If you're willing to believe it's terrible.,"Don't get me wrong. It's definitely possible to get some great shots out of it and the zoom really is fantastic, but after having it since launch and being incredibly frustrated with the shutter lag and image quality in anything but perfect outdoor light, I switched to the Pixel 8 pro.

It's shocking how big the difference is in image quality and more importantly consistency. Perfect pictures from the S24 Ultra are just as good as anything the pixel 8 pro takes, but the S24 ultra is inconsistent at best. Especially in medium or low light where it is awful.

I have a hard time now believing all these reviews after seeing firsthand the mediocre pictures the phone produced since launch. Have had the pixel for less than a week and everything has been fantastic. Except the battery life which I do miss from the ultra. The pixel is definitely not as snappy in terms of performance, but I can get over that.

Went from the Fold 2, Fold 3, Fold 4 (broke), S23 Ultra (I think the S23 ultra camera was better than the S24 Ultra), S24 Ultra, and now Pixel. No more Samsung phones for me since the camera is now my highest priority (have a 1 year old kid running around and was getting too many awful blurry pictures with the S24 Ultra).

Edit: Samsung boys, forgive me! I still have far too many high end Samsung things in my house. More than I care to admit. I'm still one of you!

Wasn't expecting reactions this strong, but I guess it makes sense.

To the people saying, try this thing or turn off intelligent optimization. I tried all that stuff and also downloaded that instant shutter app. It didn't help. A good cell phone camera is one that is good for point and shoot. It's fine to have more advanced controls, but that's not what's important.  Consistent good images with little user intervention is what makes a good camera and the S24 Ultra fails at that. The pixel 8 Pro is miles ahead of the S24 Ultra in terms of camera performance. It's not even close.

Since people were asking for examples, I've attached two. I have many good S24 Ultra shots and countless shots that came out like this. These aren't even in low light and these are the garbage images the S24 Ultra was putting out. In the last week, the Pixel has produced maybe 1 image this poor.

I also went back and looked at the pictures that my S23 Ultra was producing and I am 100% convinced that it had a better camera than the 24 Ultra. Still not Pixel level, but much better than the 24.

  
Edit 2: Definitely reassuring hearing from all the people willing to admit that there are serious issues with the camera/processing/whatever you want to call it. Also entertaining to see the ""Samsung is my one true love and you will pay"" crowd running in with all sorts of deflections. Guys, you don't get extra credit in real life for worshipping a product or a brand.

Also nice to see others agreeing with me saying that the S23 Ultra camera is better. After looking back through even more photos, it absolutely is. Samsung completely messed up the S24 Ultra camera. I remember years ago I had some other Samsung flagship, the S20 Ultra? Don't remember which one, but it also had a broken camera but I believe that was due to some dumb hardware decision they made. Either way, Samsung cameras can't be trusted IF that is your priority. If not, then no worries at all. Everything else about the phone is amazing. Just don't go yelling into the void when there are issues and you're in denial about it. For this price, the camera system can't be this bad.

Edit 3: Gotta say the amount of ""yOu DoNT knOw How To uSe youR PhOne, UsE PRO mOdE"" comments is amazing. I can't understand the mindset of someone defending a camera that can't figure out focus/exposure/shutter in fairly basic situations. Any camera that can't produce respectable shots with a single click is a failure. Any phone at this price with a camera this bad is an abomination and the fragile ego s24 Ultra boys are sad but somewhat entertaining in how far they will go to defend their toy.

I also went back and looked at the pictures that my S23 Ultra was producing and I am 100% convinced that it had a better camera than the 24 Ultra. Still not Pixel level, but much better than the 24.

  
Edit 2: Definitely reassuring hearing from all the people willing to admit that there are serious issues with the camera/processing/whatever you want to call it. Also entertaining to see the ""Samsung is my one true love and you will pay"" crowd running in with all sorts of deflections. Guys, you don't get extra credit in real life for worshipping a product or a brand.

Also nice to see others agreeing with me saying that the S23 Ultra camera is better. After looking back through even more photos, it absolutely is. Samsung completely messed up the S24 Ultra camera. I remember years ago I had some other Samsung flagship, the S20 Ultra? Don't remember which one, but it also had a broken camera but I believe that was due to some dumb hardware decision they made. Either way, Samsung cameras can't be trusted IF that is your priority. If not, then no worries at all. Everything else about the phone is amazing. Just don't go yelling into the void when there are issues and you're in denial about it. For this price, the camera system can't be this bad.

Edit 3: Gotta say the amount of ""yOu DoNT knOw How To uSe youR PhOne, UsE PRO mOdE"" comments is amazing. I can't understand the mindset of someone defending a camera that can't figure out focus/exposure/shutter in fairly basic situations. Any camera that can't produce respectable shots with a single click is a failure. Any phone at this price with a camera this bad is an abomination and the fragile ego s24 Ultra boys are sad but somewhat entertaining in how far they will go to defend their toy.

 Samsung have delayed this update too much as I received OxygenOS 15 update on my OnePlus 12 in November 2024 itself. It arises a doubt how samsung will keep up their promise of providing updates for 7 Years 😂.

Note - You have to be on OneUi 6.1 in order to install this update. If you are on Beta Rom, first rollback to 6.1 then install this.

Should have the knowledge for adb tools and drivers in order to attempt. If you don't have knowledge of tinkering with adb tools don't attempt.

I will be sending my last replacement order back when I get the time but this post is to tell everyone that grain is most likely on every device. I also have my Tab S9 Ultra beside me and which also has grain. I know what I am talking about and this time Samsung really botched it. This is also not a software problem and cannot be fixed down the road as my Tab S9 Ultra has had multiple updates and its the same grain problem the S24 Ultra also has. So, don't wait for fixes and return the device if grain bothers you too much. This is also a very known problem for OLED's (Mura Effect)

I strongly believe that most people who say they don't have the grain are ones that cannot find it. Good for them but because of that, the grain issue will most likely not reach mainstream and whatever samsung has the power to fix this, it won't. I am just ranting at this point. It's bad to tell this is a minority case but frankly speaking I received the lottery case not for once but for 4 times and had the opportunity to check 2 stranger's devices and 3 demo units. Maybe this will be rectified in the next batch of devices during manufacturing. I can vouch for devices made until Jan 31st will have grain.

I am forced to keep my original S24 Ultra as my trade-in S23 Ultra cannot be returned back to me.

I hoped I'd see a success story of replacing devices and finding the non-grain one and suggest everyone that's effected do the same. But that didn't happen. The process of replacing (which is just reordering and then price matching it) is so bad that I have an empty bank account waiting for refunds from all the devices that are currently being returned. I wish I belonged in this ""no grain bro, its so rare. Only in reddit you'll find all the complaints, not in real life"" category. Maybe there are no grain screens but its just hard to believe at this point considering my experience.

One easy thing I did to check for grain is open settings page in darkmode and focus on the background of each setting section and scroll up and down. You'll notice that grain doesn't move with the content. Don't do this if you already think you have a perfect device.

EDIT 1: No grain people, please let us know the color of your device, storage and region as well.

EDIT 2: Add another device into the mix with the grain. So a total of 5 replacements and I still was not able to get one without the grain. ","Persistent Grain Issue on Samsung S24 Ultra Displays: An Unfortunate Reality In total, I've checked 4 personal devices, 3 demo units and 2 stranger's phones where grain was present.

For me the S24 Ultra is the peak of modern day standards in every way.  
  
I see so many people complaining about ""my battery isn't lasting my whole 12h gaming session even though I charged it to 80%"" or ""the screen is way too bright/dark when laying in bed"".   
  
Just make use of your phone and charge it with the smart setting or adjust the brightness so it's not too bright...   
  
There's so many more dumb examples I could quite from this subreddit. 
At the end of the day it's a phone. It's not a professional camera, pc or a pair of 4k speakers.  
  
Have realistic expectations. The more expensive a phone is the lower value you get for the money. This applies to everything you buy.  
  
People make it seem like the S22 beats the S24U in every way, or how their 2000s nokia has louder speakers...

1731533974,Switched to an iPhone from Note 10+. Hate it. Thinking of returning for Galaxy S24 Ultra. Worth it?,"I had my Note 10+ for about 5 years. I've been hanging on to that SD card. There were a few things I disliked such as the curved screen, but for the most part I loved the customization options. I used Nova Launcher.

Last weekend I dropped the phone and cracked it. I looked into fixing it but the middle of the screen is dead.

My family all uses iPhone except me, which has impacted how we share media, make video calls. So even though I'm not into iOS, I decided to give it a try. Plus I had a discount offer.

I got the iPhone 16 Pro Max 1TB. After three days, I'm infuriated by this thing.

* Move to iOS was a pain to set up and get going. I tried over 10 times before finally being able to move just my texts. And even then it did not port my group texts over.
* I've never been a fan of the iOS design and style. It feels cartoony.
* I tried to use the camera. It was grainy! this thing has three effing lenses. What are they even for?
* I set 4 alarms this morning. None of them went off. I searched and futzed with some settings. They seem to be working now. But you cannot adjust the volume by alarm. It's all collective for both alerts and ringtones.
* Obviously the lack of home button / navigation buttons is frustrating.
* Browser tabs are vertical? I've tried a few browsers including Safari and Opera. I mean this is just maddening. Why?
* One of the last straws is CarPlay. First, it made me turn on Siri to utilize it. (Turned it off on setup.) I was searching in settings for Siri to find it, and Setting kept crashing. This is a brand new phone, what? Finally I restarted the phone and found Sirir. And when the display finally appeared, I felt ambushed by cartoonland. The colors, the fonts, the design structure. It was like an assault on my eyes compared to Android auto. One of the worst things I've ever seen.
* But THEN. As I was driving, I tried to pinch and zoom the map on both Google Maps and Apple Maps. There's no pinch and zoom. Seriously? This is one of the ways I understand what's upcoming and the various routes. You can easily do this on Android Auto.

I really did try to give it a chance. Besides the visual aesthetics, it does have a niceness to it. The speaker is pretty rich, which I appreciate. Facetiming with my family is so much easier. And... I'm not sure what else.

I'm thinking of returning this phone and getting a Galaxy S24 Ultra, which seems closest to a new successor to my Note.

There are a few things holding me back from purchasing.

* Since it no longer has an SD card, I want the 1T. I use a lot of media and don't have great experiences with the cloud. I like physical access. But the 1T is fucking expensive. I'd be paying $700 more for the S24 Ultra than I did for my Pro with my offer discount.
* Despite all the ways I don't enjoy iOS, I do have a Macbook and I like it well enough for my computing purposes. But it has sucked having an Android phone. That was also where the SD card was nice because I could transfer files between the two. I don't know how I'll do that with the S24 Ultra.
* I do like the family communication capabilities.
* And lastly, I'm still researching this phone -
   * Is it worth the upgrade?
   * Is the camera better or at least good enough more than the iPhone 16 Pro Max?
   * What are some of the newer features of the Galaxy S24 Ultra that the Note 10+ did not have?
   * Besides the SD card, what are some of the things this phone has lost?

TL;DR - The title sums it up nicely. Plus CarPlay sucks, like you can't pinch and zoom the map.

* Browser tabs are vertical? I've tried a few browsers including Safari and Opera. I mean this is just maddening. Why?
* One of the last straws is CarPlay. First, it made me turn on Siri to utilize it. (Turned it off on setup.) I was searching in settings for Siri to find it, and Setting kept crashing. This is a brand new phone, what? Finally I restarted the phone and found Sirir. And when the display finally appeared, I felt ambushed by cartoonland. The colors, the fonts, the design structure. It was like an assault on my eyes compared to Android auto. One of the worst things I've ever seen.
* But THEN. As I was driving, I tried to pinch and zoom the map on both Google Maps and Apple Maps. There's no pinch and zoom. Seriously? This is one of the ways I understand what's upcoming and the various routes. You can easily do this on Android Auto.

I really did try to give it a chance. Besides the visual aesthetics, it does have a niceness to it. The speaker is pretty rich, which I appreciate. Facetiming with my family is so much easier. And... I'm not sure what else.

I'm thinking of returning this phone and getting a Galaxy S24 Ultra, which seems closest to a new successor to my Note.

There are a few things holding me back from purchasing.

* Since it no longer has an SD card, I want the 1T. I use a lot of media and don't have great experiences with the cloud. I like physical access. But the 1T is fucking expensive. I'd be paying $700 more for the S24 Ultra than I did for my Pro with my offer discount.
* Despite all the ways I don't enjoy iOS, I do have a Macbook and I like it well enough for my computing purposes. But it has sucked having an Android phone. That was also where the SD card was nice because I could transfer files between the two. I don't know how I'll do that with the S24 Ultra.
* I do like the family communication capabilities.
* And lastly, I'm still researching this phone -
   * Is it worth the upgrade?
   * Is the camera better or at least good enough more than the iPhone 16 Pro Max?
   * What are some of the newer features of the Galaxy S24 Ultra that the Note 10+ did not have?
   * Besides the SD card, what are some of the things this phone has lost?

TL;DR - The title sums it up nicely. Plus CarPlay sucks, like you can't pinch and zoom the map.

1712470969,I think I found a fake galaxy s24 ultra?,"Found this thing in a gutter while I was riding my bike. I am not a Samsung user so to me it felt fine but it had a dead battery, so I put it in my satchel with intention to charge it at home and see if I can find the owner.

I plugged it in, turned it on, and it was slow, like really laggy and screen looked really bad in comparison to my pixel 8. I know samsung makes one of the best screens on the market, so something was definitely off.

Another weird thing was that it had nothing, zero call history, zero apps, zero messages. No browser history either.

When I was digging around I couldn't believe that this can be a $1000+ phone. Then I noticed the chin, then I went to a website that checks resolution. Then I covered all the cameras and only top one was working during the whole zoom range, and quality of photos is atrocious.

IMEI comes clean and valid, and phone seems to be built very well, but I am 99% sure I found a fake.

I think maybe someone was scammed and realized too late and out of frustration they through the phone out of the car window.","I think I found a fake galaxy s24 ultra?

1730791575,Samsung S24 Ultra vs Vivo X200 Pro: Real-World Camera Comparison You Need to See,"Alright, after diving into some real-world tests, I think it’s safe to say the Vivo X200 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are both camera beasts, but they’re definitely not equal across the board. Here’s my take on where each one shines (and where they don’t).

Where the Vivo X200 Pro Really Stands Out:

Image Quality:

Detail & Sharpness: Vivo’s images are impressively sharp, especially in good lighting. The amount of detail it pulls out is seriously impressive.

Color Accuracy: Vivo’s got those Zeiss-tuned sensors, and you can tell. Colors look vibrant but still natural.

Dynamic Range: In high-contrast scenes, the Vivo seems to handle highlights and shadows a bit better, so you get a nice balanced look.

Low-Light Performance: This is a big one. The larger sensor on the Vivo helps it pull in more light, so you end up with brighter, clearer low-light shots.


Zoom Capabilities:

Optical Zoom: If you’re into zoomed shots, Vivo’s higher optical zoom makes a noticeable difference. You get a clearer, more detailed image, even when you’re zoomed in.


Video Recording:

Stabilization: When it comes to stabilization, especially if you’re walking or moving around, the Vivo holds up better. It’s just smoother overall.



Where the Samsung S24 Ultra Falls a Bit Short:

Look, the S24 Ultra is still a solid option, but here’s where I think it could use some tweaks:

Low-Light Performance: It’s not bad, but when compared side-by-side, Vivo edges it out in terms of brightness and clarity.

Color Accuracy: Samsung’s colors are nice, but if you’re looking for that extra vibrancy, Vivo seems to bring it out a bit better.

Video Stabilization: Samsung’s not bad here either, but for some reason, Vivo just feels a bit smoother in trickier conditions like walking or filming on uneven ground.


The Bottom Line:

Both phones are impressive, no doubt. But if I had to pick one based purely on camera quality, the Vivo X200 Pro might have the edge here with better detail, zoom, and low-light performance. That being said, it’s not night and day – Samsung still holds its own, and software updates could always change the game.

What Do You All Think?
Has anyone here tried either of these cameras out? I’d love to know how they stack up in your experience. Let’s hear some real-world opinions (and if you’ve got pics to show off, even better)!

1742424724,Need Advice on Switching Back to Android – Is This S24 Ultra Legit?,"Hey everyone,
I’m new to posting but would really appreciate your help!
Here’s some context: I’ve been a longtime Samsung user, from the Note 9 to the S22 Ultra. Unfortunately, my S22 Ultra was recently damaged, and where I live, repair costs are so high that it’s often better to just buy a new phone. So, I traded it for an iPhone 13 Pro Max since I wanted to try out iOS with a 120Hz display without spending too much.

So far, the experience has been great—the battery life is significantly better than the S22 Ultra, the animations are super smooth, and everything just works seamlessly. However, I really miss Android, especially the customization options and modded apps. I tried sideloading apps on the iPhone, but it’s way more complicated than I expected, and having to refresh them every week is a hassle.

Now, I’m considering switching back and getting the S24 Ultra. I found some listings on Facebook Marketplace that I like, but I wanted to make sure they’re legit. The seller sent me some pictures, but to me, the bezels look a bit bigger than expected. Does this seem normal to you?

Also, my S22 Ultra used to lag with animations (One UI 6). Has Android improved in that regard?

Since I’m currently using the iPhone as my main phone, is there a way to back up my data to my PC, wipe the iPhone, and then transfer everything to the Samsung once I get it?

Would love to hear your thoughts—thanks in advance!","Need Advice on Switching Back to Android – Is This S24 Ultra Legit? Hey everyone,

5. **Choose 'Overheating'**: After selecting 'Error Reports', pick the third option labeled 'Overheating'.
6. **Handle 'Language not supported' Error**: If you encounter a 'Language not supported' message, just hit 'Cancel' and proceed with your report.
7. **Detail the Issue**: Mention how frequently the overheating occurs and describe the situation in which it happens. The more details, the better.
8. **Attach System Logs**: Ensure the 'Send system log data' box is checked to provide Samsung with essential technical insights.

1726675219,"Samsung s20~s24 is not Samsung's ""fall off"" era, you guys are just mean","I'm seeing a lot of posts recently about how Samsung has fallen off in terms of design and how it's ""knockoff Apple"" now due to the new Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Watch Ultra.

I'd argue Samsung has never looked better, the s24 line is probably the best designed androids by far in terms of how it can look like a blank slate but each user can make it their own while also delivering on superb hardware.

Samsung has also been more active than ever in their foldable innovation, sure, it's been slow since the fold/flip 4 series. But let's be honest, no other company has made foldables as consistently structurally sound as Samsung, they've pushed the foldable competition on their own by so much that I would rather see another company step on their heels to drive more innovation.

Also people are really REALLY dismissive of their tablets, which isn't particularly Samsung's fault per se, moreso that the Ipad has just been so ultra dominant in the tablet space that's it's 99% of the time ""the one to beat"". But if you just took a second and grabbed one Samsung's more recent tablet models like the s8, you'd realize how nice it is to have the really good hardware that a tablet can take advantage of, without the restrictions lf just using IpadOS. Their biggest downside, probably not having procreate and that's it, if you're an artist then Apple just suits you.

I don't see how you can villainize Samsung while also talking big game about Apple, when Samsung is consistently Apple's best competitor. I will admit, Samsung is really just the Apple of Android, but that's only if they keep getting compared to Apple as is... Which is always... But try to be more open minded about how far they've come from way back in the s5 era, those years might've been more unique and sillier, but if we still had ""old"" Samsung stuff, they wouldn't have lasted long in today's demands.

Samsung is a company that competes with Apple catering to a massive umbrella of people, their hardware is designed to be this minimalist for that reason, if you wanted a more experimental Android then at least we're spoiled with options there. But as it is on its own, Samsung really hasn't been any better than in this moment.

But as it is on its own, Samsung really hasn't been any better than in this moment.

1740849863,"Before You Hit ""Update"", Think TWICE!","**Samsung's Software Updates: A Silent Killer for Performance?**

Samsung has long been known for its premium hardware, but what if I told you their software updates are intentionally designed to slow down your device? Over the years, many users like me have suspected that major software updates gradually reduce battery life, camera performance, and overall speed—pushing users to upgrade to the latest model. To test this theory, I made a hypothesis in [***my previous post*** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/S24Ultra/comments/1iyp750/youre_forced_to_upgrade_arent_you/)and many of you wanted a detailed testing procedure. So, I conducted an experiment using three Galaxy S24 Ultra devices.

**The Experiment: Same Device, Different Software Updates**

I tested three Galaxy S24 Ultra units:

* **Device 1:** Brand new, production date May 2024 (on May 24 patch).
* **Device 2:** Brand new, production date May 2024 (on January 25 patch).
* **Device 3:** My personal unit, production date March 2024 (on January 25 patch).

**Testing Conditions: Real-World Use, Not Just Benchmarks**

To ensure fairness, I tested all three devices under identical conditions:

* **Same cellular network** (same SIM provider and signal conditions).
* **Cellular calls** for 1.5 hours each.
* **Daily apps**: Instagram, YouTube video streaming, Netflix, Facebook, Reddit, and WhatsApp.
* **Camera usage**: Photos and videos in various lighting conditions, including night mode and HDR.
* **Gaming**: Subway Surfers and PUBG Mobile.
* **AnTuTu Graphics Stress Test** to push GPU performance.
* **Kept in room temperature** 27℃.
* **Same settings**:
   * **Adaptive battery:** Turned off.
   * **No background activity**.
   * **No bloatware**.
   * **Same apps & versions, same sales region for all the three phones**.
   * **Performance profile:** Standard mode.
   * **Brightness level:** 70%.
   * **Always-on display:** Turned on.

# The Results: A Clear Performance Decline

**Battery Performance Drops After Update**

I flashed the **March 2024 security update** (S928BXXS1AXBN) onto devices 2 & 3 (which were on the January 25 patch before) to match them all on a similar state. Device 1 remained in the May 24 (S928BXXS2AXD5) patch as I couldn't flash the **March patch** on it, don’t know why!

Then, I monitored the **Screen-On Time (SoT):**

* **Brand-new devices:** More than **7 hours 30 minutes** of SoT.
* **My personal device:** Over **7 hours** of SoT. (Understandable, as the battery had degraded slightly.)

After updating to the **January 2025 patch** (S928BXXS4AYA1) to all three devices:

* SoT dropped to **6 hours 15-40 minutes**—a noticeable decline.

Even on standby mode, the battery drained faster than expected, making it difficult to last a full day. This decline suggests the update may have introduced new background processes or inefficiencies that weren't present in the older firmware, or its planned obsolescence??

**Camera Performance Has Degraded**

Photos take longer to process, especially in night mode. Longer processing time for HDR shots, making quick captures frustrating. Increased noise and softer details, even in well-lit environments. Colors appear duller than before, losing their vibrancy and contrast. The brand-new camera experience is gone already.

**Device Responsiveness Becomes Sluggish**

Animations and scrolling feel slower, making the device less fluid. Apps take longer to open, especially heavier applications. Multi-tasking has noticeable lag, even when switching between just two apps. Read/write speeds dropped by 8-10%, affecting app performance.

**Gaming Performance Shows Micro-Stutters**

PUBG Mobile shows frequent frame drops, making gameplay less smooth. Device heats up to 43℃ after extended play, whereas before, it remained cooler. Frame rate consistency dropped by 7% over long gaming sessions, affecting responsiveness. Longer loading times for high-performance apps, including games and video editors.

# Interesting Fact: No Way Back!

Samsung is way too smart—once you update your phone, no matter how many times you go back and flash an older firmware, the performance and feel remain the same as the latest update. This suggests deep-level firmware optimizations that persist even after downgrading. I could identify this fact by comparing the two new devices side by side.

**Samsung’s Updates: Secretly Slowing Down Your Phone?**

This performance downgrade isn't an accident—it seems intentional. Samsung wants the **Galaxy S25 Ultra** to feel like a gigantic upgrade over its predecessor. However, when the **S24 Ultra first launched, it was a beast.** It ran smoothly, had exceptional battery life, and delivered top-tier performance. Now, post-update, it’s just another ordinary smartphone. If you hold an **S25 Ultra today**, you will feel the same punch you did when you bought the **S24 Ultra** last year. But the **updated S24 Ultra** is way behind the comparison So, what really changed in just **11 months**?

**Samsung’s Hidden Strategy: Why Do They Do This?**

The most logical explanation is **planned obsolescence**. While Apple has been caught doing this in the past, Samsung appears to be implementing similar tactics, but more subtly. Their seven-year software update promise sounds great, but if devices start underperforming within a year, how usable will they be by year three? Some might call this a conspiracy theory, but it raises an important question: **Should we trust manufacturers blindly when it comes to software updates?** Instead of silently nerfing performance, Samsung should be more transparent about how updates impact older devices.

So, if your phone runs smoothly, ask yourself—do you really need that next security patch right now? While security updates are essential, they shouldn't come at the cost of usability. Before you hit “update,” think twice!

**Disclaimer: The Challenge of Providing Hard Evidence**

While my test results strongly suggest a performance decline, I must clarify that I cannot provide absolute proof or raw data logs. Due to technical constraints, including Samsung's encrypted bootloader and firmware restrictions, independent performance tracking is difficult. Additionally, Samsung does not allow full downgrades to previous firmware versions, making long-term comparative analysis nearly impossible. However, many users—including myself—have reported similar experiences, further supporting the idea that Samsung's updates may intentionally degrade performance.

1740120439,Battery Tips for s24 Ultra. For 7h+ SOT,"Display & Performance Settings

Keep 2K resolution – It doesn't impact performance much.

Switch to Light Mode – No effect on performance, but can help with battery life.

Gaming Mode – Phones automatically switch to performance mode while gaming.


Battery Optimization Tips

Deep Sleep Apps – Add junk apps or apps that don’t need background usage.

Restrict Background Usage – When installing new apps, go to their battery settings and set them to Restricted if they don’t require background data.

Use Smart Routines:

Set a routine to turn off Adaptive Brightness 5 seconds after unlocking the phone.

Create a routine to turn off mobile data when connected to WiFi (WiFi doesn’t automatically disable mobile data).



Network & Connectivity

Use 4G LTE only – 4G speeds are good for normal use, and 5G consumes twice the power.

Smart GPS Usage – Limit GPS usage to certain apps (though this may affect ""Find My Device"").

Turn Off Nearby Device Scanning – It’s useless for most people and drains battery.


App Restrictions

Restrict background usage for apps like Facebook & Instagram – They consume battery and invade privacy even when the screen is locked.


Final Notes

If these optimizations don’t help, nothing else will.

Gaming significantly reduces SOT – Samsung Galaxy devices consume a lot of power while gaming.

If you're playing games and still getting decent Screen-On Time (SOT), then it’s perfectly fine.

Im not talking about the 120hz screen or the cameras, im talking about the software and the speed at which things are happening, loading, connecting, and downoading on this thing. 
Feels like every action here is 5x faster than the iPhone. 

I didn't even start to play with the thousands of options here, or the Spen, or the AI stuff , or Dex. This is just first impressions of a guy who just switched from iPhone to Samsung for the first time in his life. 

Everything feels so snappy , this is amazing. 
I was able to transfer ALL my data via USB and connect to every needed account so fast. 
I didn't even start to play with customization options here. This is all default now , including the Samsumg keyboard, which I was sure im going to hate, but i don't. i really like it. I like everything here.

This is it, folks. This phone is from 2024, while the iPhone seems to be stuck somewhere in 2018, or at least that's what i feel. And to think i paid so much for iPhones and got the same device in a different package for years. This is just sad. But as i said in the beginning, there was no hate for Apple. They are doing their thing, but it seems that Samsungs ""thing"" is just so much advanced and years ahead.


I was very afraid that i would miss my iPhone and miss my comfort zone, but goddamn this is so much better than i even thought . This is perfect. 

If you are hesitant like me. Dont be. You will probably fall in love with what Samsung is done with this device.

1733424178,How to install one UI beta on Canada S24 ultra ,"Is it possible to install one UI beta on a Canadian model s24 ultra. 





****Edit****

To anyone wanting to install the one ui beta 7 on  SM-S928W these are the following steps you will have to take. I have provided a step by step tutorial & links to the files I used. I will also include a Google drive link at the bottom of this post with everything you will need (except samsung usb drivers)

1: Download the ""usa"" u1 firmware. I used t-mobile from 

https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-s24-ultra/firmware/SM-S928U1/TMB/download/S928U1UES3AXI1/1879370/

2: Extract the firmware you just downloaded to a new folder

3: Download odin 3.14.4 from

 https://odindownload.com/mobile/

4: ***** BACKUP***** you're device via Samsung cloud or Google cloud as you will loose you're DATA!

5: Enter download mode. 

Turn off your device by holding down the Power and Volume Down buttons for three seconds, then tapping Power Off twice.
Connect your device to a computer using a USB-C cable.
While holding down the Volume Up and Volume Down keys on your phone, continue until a warning prompt appears. Press volume up to continue

6: Launch odin & populate the BL,AP,CP,CSC. You can do this by clicking on them individually and navigating to the folder you extracted the firmware to. 

****Note**** When populating csc. Choose "" CSC_OYM "" NOT "" HOME_SCC_Oym "" & leave userdata blank.

Click start & wait for the process to complete. You're phone should reboot once finished. Complete the setup process. Congrats youre now on U1 firmware.

9: Download & install the samsung so drivers from 

https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver

8: Enable developer options by navigating to settings,about phone,software information & click repeatedly 5 times on build number. Developer options should be enabled now.

At the very bottom of your settings menu open up developer options & enable usb debugging.


9: Download & extract sdk platform tools from 

https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools

10: Download the *****US U1***** one ui 7 beta from

https://xdaforums.com/t/beta-1-now-rolling-out-one-ui-7-beta-galaxy-s24-ultra-beta-thread-update-zip-files-news-and-discussion.4683065/

You will need to rename the file to update.zip 

Cut/copy the update.zip file & paste it into the root directory of the platform-tools folder. 

*****NOTE***** The download link I provided to the beta firmware above I could only download with a VPN enabled. I think his is because it's from an unsecured server. As mentioned above I have provided a Google drive link at the bottom of this post with everything needed. 


12: Navigate to the root directory of the platform-tools folder.  Inside this folder, while holding left shift, make a right click with the mouse and select ""open command prompt here""

Connect your phone to your computer & accept the prompt to allow connection to the pc. In the opened Command Prompt window on your PC, type in the following command: ./adb reboot recovery your phone will reboot into recovery mode.

In recovery mode on your phone, select ""update via ADB"". (you scroll up or down using the volume buttons and select using the power button).

In the Command Prompt/Windows Powershell on your PC run the following command: ""./adb devices"" Wait to see a message saying that the daemon has started and that your device is found. 

If you device is found, run the following command:  ./adb sideload update.zip

The process will start and show you the progress in the command prompt.


Once the process is completed you phone will start booting. Congrats you now have oneui beta 7.



*****LImitations & Notes*****

You will not be able to participate in the beta feedback via Samsung members app.

When an update is pushed you will need to manually install it 

When stable releases you will need to manually install it. The stable firmware will be posted on www.sammobile.com it's recommended o just switch back to a Canadian firmware so ou can get started updates again. 


Everything works 5g,wifi,Bluetooth ect...

My battery life is absolutely incredible now!

1713813028,Is the s24 ultra worth it?,"Okay so I’ve been part of this subreddit since nearly its inception when there were only 3-5 of us in here. And I’ve been looking at all of the posts over the past few months, researching on if it’s worth it or not to buy the s24 ultra, since I’m typing this from an iPhone 13 Pro,  I’m debating on whether or not it’s worth the money. Like besides the back glass being broken my phone works perfectly fine and I really have no real reason to upgrade. The only reasons are 

* I want to try the UI since it’s highly customizable 

* I want to just switch it up from iPhone 

* I don’t really like how anti consumer Apple is and although they make great products, they just are innovating anymore, while Samsung is ACTUALLY trying

* the s24 ultra looks so nice 

However there are a few cons

* I’m in the US, where 97% of teens use iPhone and therefore iMessage 

* I own an Apple Watch and AirPods 

* my family has Apple products and I have multiple Apple only group chats. 

* I film a lot and most people say the camera on the s24 are best for photographers not cinematographers so idk if the camera will hold up (video wise)

* it’s $1500 and my family isn’t in the best financial situation so is it really the best desicion to buy another liability?


Ultimately I need the perspective of people who have switched from Apple to Samsung, but any advice will help

Just gonna start by saying I've been a samsung fan boy for a long time and always preferred samsung over other brands, especially Apple. I've had multiple galaxy phones and I finally got the S24 ultra for black friday, my first flagship phone and I was super excited. 

But, as the days went by I realized that not much has really changed with samsung phones. I had a note 20 and the 24 ultra honestly feels like the same phone but a little faster. Then more time when by am I started to see the issues with the S24 ultra. The S-pen feels super cheap compared to the notes pen, the camera isn't really that great (struggles with focus more than the note in certain lighting), the AI is just a gimmick that isn't used because it's a bit janky and not as smooth as shown in their demos (it's a glorified Google search/translate/whatever tool Google already has), bluetooth connectivity keeps getting dropped (never with my note 20 on the same devices) and now this junk wont charge because it detects moisture  in the port that isnt there. I Googled the moisture issue and I'm not the first one with this, its a known issue. For a flagship phone this is absolutely junk and an utter failure of a flagships first year on the market.

I can't believe I am saying this but I actually regret getting this phone. My cousin got the IPhone 16 max pro the same day I got this and that thing is a beast. I'm so let down by samsung with this that I don't even know what to do. I kind wanna migrate to Apple because alteast they have some consistency with thier phones, sure they are all the same with limited improvements between generations but hey, their phones work and always deliver.

1707351926,Games crashing on S24 Ultra - likely to return the phone in 2 days (example: Pokemon GO),"Hello. I absolutely adore the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. I upgraded from an S22 Ultra, and am surprised how much better the S24 Ultra works, feels, and looks.

However, games like Pokemon GO constantly crash, often up to 7 times per hour. It's crashed so often that the operating system has asked that I put the game in Deep Sleep. I'd be happier if this was an isolated issue with my phone, but there are lots of reports on Reddit ([example](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22pokemon%20go%22%20s24&t=month)), other forums, and social media.

I have tried:

* Force-closing the app
* Restarting the phone
* Clearing app cache
* Clearing app storage
* Formatting the phone
* Installing the Galaxy Store version
* Installing version within Secure Folder
* Using and not using Game Booster, with various settings
* Contacting Niantic, the developer of Pokemon GO

It seems like this may be a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 issue, as other recently-released phones with this SoC seem to have the same issue. The Pokemon GO game crashes at all times: idle on the home screen, battling in PvP, fighting in a raid, swiping through my storage items, looking through my Pokemon, and even clicking around in settings.

My return period will end in 2 days, and I guess I'll be returning this phone, unfortunately. If this one issue could be fixed, this $1,419.99 would have been worth it. I've spent over $200 on accessories (e.g., cases, MagSafe products) on the phone, and it's going to cost me some money to return them, so that will be a waste of time and money.

If anyone has thoughts about this, please do share. If you are also experiencing this issue, please post a comment - even a simple one - so others are aware of how widespread this issue may be. Thank you and take care.","Games crashing on S24 Ultra - likely to return the phone in 2 days (example: Pokemon GO) Hello. I absolutely adore the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

I've recently made the leap from being a long-term iOS user to using the Samsung S24 Ultra, and I'm curious to hear from all of you—what's holding back those of you who haven't made the switch yet? Here's a bit about my experience:

My Take:

I was deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem but decided to explore the S24 Ultra. The screen quality, customization, and overall hardware have been spectacular. However, there's one thing I miss:

Voice Assistant Integration: I used to rely heavily on Siri with my AirPods for hands-free tasks. The transition to Bixby on Android has been less than seamless for me. I'm hoping future updates like One UI 7 will bridge this gap, as this could be a significant deterrent for many considering the switch.

Your Turn:

Whether you're an iPhone loyalist or an Android aficionado, what are the reasons you might not be tempted by the S24 Ultra?

For iPhone Users:
Is it the camera, the ecosystem, or something else?
Do you value the simplicity and integration of Apple's devices?
For Android Users:
Are you satisfied with your current device's features?
Maybe it's the brand loyalty or different features that other Android phones offer?
Are there specific features like voice assistant functionality, app availability, or hardware design that you're not willing to compromise on?

I'd love to hear from both sides of the fence to understand what keeps you where you are or what might finally push you to try the S24 Ultra. Share your thoughts, concerns, or even what you think would be the game-changing feature for a switch.

I couldn’t believe it, but I found the four-sided curved display of the iPhones to look really strange and somewhat “odd,” especially on the smaller models. Maybe I’ve just gotten too used to the S24 Ultra’s screen. I used to think that curved design was amazing and “ergonomic.”

Another small thing I noticed is that the camera module on the 16 Pro series looks quite unbalanced compared to the overall back design, even though the size of the lineup has increased this year.

• I don’t really use iCloud either. I’ve always used google photos to backup my photos. 

• the only Apple item I have other than iPhone is my MacBook (use 365 and google Drive for files bc not many people here use OS system for file sharing)

• I’m switching to Samsung from Apple bc I recently got a lot of time on my hand and getting a shiny new phone just to treat myself as I’ll be travelling quite frequently later this year. So I wanted a phone with better battery life and good photos where I don’t have to try so hard to get a good shot of sceneries and views. ","Long time iPhone user switching to S24 Ultra update: writing this on my 24U. I love it!!!!! Didn't take long for me to adjust. And i couldn't be happier with the fact that I've only been using google drive and photos to store my data and photos instead of iCloud. The transition was very seamless. 

I'm a long time iPhone user (since iPhone 4) and first time using Samsung. and switching to s24 Ultra from iPhone 14 Plus. Any tips and tricks?

  
also please drop your favourite camera setting here for easy shoots. I am not very good with mobile photography so i need to set the camera setting to something easy and also want the results to be good (no need to be pro level).

Edit: more info about my tech use would help this post I guess. Thank you for all kind words, tips and suggestions.

1708342643,Sta uzeti: Iphone 15 pro ili Galaxy S24 Ultra?,"Cao ekipa, ustedeo sam nesto love i prvi put u zivotu mogu sebi da priustim flagship telefon. 

Do sad sam koristio uglavnom Samsunge, poslednji Samsung A52 i relativno sam zadovoljan. Iphone nikad nisam koristio, mada sam svestan ovako na prvi pogled koliko je kamera bolja, ostrija i generalno koliko su slike sto se tice kvaliteta superiornije.

Gledao sam dosta testova i poredjenja onlajn, ali mi se cini da je 90% sranje koje gura jedna ili druga strana da bi uvalila svoj proizvod a da je premalo objektivnih i fer recenzija. 

Ima li neko sugestiju, sta uzeti?

1741081674,Downgrading from samsung s24 ultra,"I have been trapped in the fangs of consumerism for a while now. I have been buying things I don't need just for the sake of having. I am currently in a season where I'm embrascing minimalism. That said, among other things, I want to get rid of my s24 ultra and get something in the A series. A55 maybe because I read it does not have a plastic back. 

I know of companies that exchange phones but they only do upgrades and not downgrades.  

If I sell the phone (i don't even know how to do this and at what price) I would not have a phone to use in the interim. 

It's a pretty well maintained phone, bought less than a year ago and still under samsung care.

How should I go about it and is a55 a good phone?

1745082703,Why is data transfer so slow? S24 Ultra,"So I have USB 3.0 and the Samsung S24 ultra and yet when I do transfer I'm getting like 2 megabytes a second maybe 20 at the most and it's sort of randomly up and down. Can't figure out why.

This computer has basically been garbage since the day I bought it. I absolutely can't stand it. I want my old cyberpower with a Ryzen 5.

This has an Intel Core i7 14700 with a NVIDIA 4060 TI 64 gigabytes of ram etcetera. I don't know if it's iBuypower or Microsoft. I think it's windows 11 and Microsoft garbage. Dragging and pasting 1 file in explorer takes like 8 to 20 seconds and you just get a perpetual hourglass and spinning circle for everything on this piece of junk. So I don't know if the problem with the data transfer is just because of windows or the hardware packages just junk or maybe iBuypower is garbage too. I've tried all the tricks and bypasses and everything and it's just no real results. Even using a third party browser like Onecommander hasn't proved to be very much better.","Why is data transfer so slow?

1743932605,Buying S24 Ultra from Dubai—Will Jio 5G Work in India? Which Model to Choose? Need Advice + Box Pics if Possible!,"Hey everyone, I’m planning to buy a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra from Dubai because it’s significantly cheaper there compared to India. However, I’ve heard some concerns that Jio 5G (especially SA/Standalone 5G) doesn’t work properly on imported models of the S24 Ultra 

Before making the purchase, I’d like to know:

1. Is it true that imported S24 Ultra units (like the ones from the UAE or the US) face issues with Jio’s 5G network in India, either in terms of compatibility or signal reliability?


2. Which specific variant or model number (e.g., SM-S928B/DS, SM-S928U, etc.) should I go for to ensure full compatibility with Indian network bands, especially for Jio 5G (including both SA and NSA modes)?


3. Has anyone here used an imported S24 Ultra in India with Jio or Airtel 5G? If yes, how has your experience been in terms of network connectivity, VoNR (Voice over 5G), and software updates?


4. Also, if you’ve bought your S24 Ultra from the UAE and are using it in India with Jio 5G working fine, could you please share a photo of your phone’s box (especially the label side with the model number)? Would really help!



Would really appreciate any advice or personal experiences—thanks in advance!

1705594700,Galaxy S24 Ultra PWM rate,"Wanted to post the PWM measurements for the Galaxy S24 Ultra for anyone interested in trying it. Based on my Opple Light Master IV readings on a pure white background, Samsung seems to have finally moved up to 480Hz PWM dimming and the screen exhibits a friendlier sine wave than other Samsung phones.

Despite the change, it still hurts my eyes within a few minutes if I don't use my reading/astigmatism-correction glasses. As we all know, sensitivity is deeply personal and differs for everyone, but I'm hoping a few folks here will be able to take advantage of these changes. I'll have more to post about on Android Central over the next few weeks.

Also, the photo was taken at 1/6400 shutter for those who like to do the math.
